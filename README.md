# Daily Workday Calendar

## How it works:

I have a created an online daily schedule. When you go the website, you will be greeted with todays date and time at the top. 

You will then see timeblocks for standard business hours. The time blocks are colour coded, so any time block in the past is grey, the current time block is red and future time blocks are green. You are able to write information in any of the time blocks and when you click save, the information is saved to the computers local storage. 

## Screenshots:
